Summary: YouTube is one of the largest online entertainment industries. Anyone with a Google account can upload short and long-form videos to the platform. People who have found success on the platform, often called content creators, post videos and hope to make it on YouTube’s trending page. What do all of these trending videos have in common? What statistics make the YouTube algorithm classify a video as trending? We want to allow content creators to understand what makes a video get on the YouTube trending page.  

Our research will use:

    Association Rule Mining (Apriori)

    Linear Regression

    Logistic Regression


# Repository and Installation setup

- All software used to run our Jupyter Notebooks is in Google Colab.
    - You could also open the Jupyter Notebooks within Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook installed on your device; however, we will not cover how to install/set up that method. 
- To access Google Colab, you only need a Gmail account, which you can use for your current or personal email.
    - Here is the website for Google Colab: https://colab.google/
- Download the Jupyter Notebooks along with the clean .csv files (data) from the 'cleaned_data' folder to your local machine.
- Once you have opened Google Colab, on the main website click 'open colab'. This will take you to a new page and prompt you with a box having multiple section tabs.
- Click the 'Upload' tab and select the Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine.
    - Within the Jupyter Notebooks, there will be a cell that you can run that will allow you to choose the .csv files (data files) which you will select and be uploaded within the respective Jupyter Notebook project.
